You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
I have learned to use native HTML5 to structure a document.

What has been easy?
I found it easy to learn about and find new HTML 5 in the documentation provided.

What has been difficult?
The screen shot appears to be very dificult way to provide information about a mockup. Without being able to either ask the design question or provide a mockup with metadata (such as a layered PSD file), it was very hard to get the mockup to look 'identical' to the provided file. It appears to be a slightly zoomed file and may have a font (Georgia semibold) that is not a typical web safe font.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I first exmained the requirements (the image) and develop a plan. Next, I aquired new knowledge through reading the suggested documentation. Then I excicuted my development plan and refined my solution throughout the process. Lastly, I validated my solution with the mockup. I used the growth mindset to both ensure a successful outcome and to expand my knowledge.
